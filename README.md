# TodoListMySQLConnector
To do list app made with Java Swing and MySQL, this app contains:
  - An authentication system.
  - An Admin page where the admin can manage users.
  - A Client page where clients can manage thier to do lists.
For security reasons, only an admin can add another admin, so it is recomended to insert an admin record into the account table like i did in the "db.sql" file.
